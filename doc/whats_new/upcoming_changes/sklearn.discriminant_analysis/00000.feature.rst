- Added :class:`~sklearn.discriminant_analysis.IncrementalLinearDiscriminantAnalysis`,
  an incremental variant of linear discriminant analysis supporting streaming
  updates via :meth:`partial_fit` with the ``'svd'``, ``'lsqr'``, and ``'eigen'``
  solvers. The ``'lsqr'`` and ``'eigen'`` solvers include support for
  ``shrinkage='auto'`` using a streaming Ledoit-Wolf estimate derived from a
  rolling residual buffer.
